Q1 Why . is used with value typed?
ans -> it makes the wrapper object of the variable at backend and the process is called autoboxing,then that value after particular operation is given to the value,this process is called auto unboxing.

var x=10 // value
var x= new Number() // auto boxing


Q2 What is null value and where we use it? Hint: typeof
ans-> null is an empty or unknown value that represents an object doesn't have any reference.


Q3 typeof ?
ans--> an operator which is used to show the type of the operand in form of string.
Q4 Null vs undefined
ans--> undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.
Q5 == vs ===
ans--> '==' is a loose equality that compares the content of two types by considering them as of same types and '===' us strict equality operator that compares the two variables and returns true iff they have same value and same type
